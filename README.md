# Machine-Learning-Specialization
These codes are some of the projects (Practice and optional Labs) that I did when I took Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera, offered by Stanford Online and DeepLearning.AI.

The specialization includes 3 courses: 1-Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification 2-Advanced Learning Algorithms (Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Tree ensemble methods) 3- Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning.
